Odin Landing Page Project

This is my second project in TOP's curriculum! This project will test my recently acquired CSS Flexbox knowledge as I build a basic landing page based off of a specified design. The design is provided by Odin as a picture along with some additional details and constraints. The goal is to utilize Flexbox to build out the specified design completely from scratch. Some knowledge I hope to use..

- correct use of `divs` and `spans` as flex containers
- rely on inheritance to express the same functionality but with cleaner CSS and HTML code
- correct use of `flex: auto, initial, none, or 1, 2, 3, etc.`
- using flex properties like `gap` and `margin` to simplify CSS code
- maintaining a responsive design that works well for both mobile and desktop

Please enjoy!
